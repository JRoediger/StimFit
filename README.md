This is the Matlab code of the StimFit algorithm to predict optimal stimulation parameters in patients treated with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). A detailed technical description as well as results of retrospective and prospective validation studies can be found in the following publications:

The software currently requires DBS electrodes reconstructed with Lead-DBS (https://github.com/netstim/leaddbs) as well as a trained model. This software is not a licensed medical product. For more information feel free to contact me (jan.roediger@charite.de).
